This project is a short tutorial to demonstrate how to make
a Elixir App whithout use of Phoenix Framework.
You can follow step by step the process of creation of this project
if you see the "elixir_cloud.pptx" file.
For more detailed and explained tutorial (PT-BR only) follow steps and instructions

This project and the .pptx file was created to be submitted to a
tecnical conference, because this some things will could be bit
strange on this context.

Basically I explore the concepts of a REST-Like application, and
how to it whit elixir. These type of information until now is very
fragmented in the Web. 
Other concept not easy to find how to that is presented is concurrent programming. 


Organization:

- elixir_cloud.pptx: Presentation file.
- ex_cipher: Root folder of Elixir Application. This is core of all.
- ang-app: Root folder for an Angular 9 Application. This is an auxiliar app
  created for demonstrate more user friendly the communication whit the 
  Elixir Application. (You can create yourself UI application to comunicate
  whit this Elixir Application whit any language, this is one of advantages
  of use Elixir whithout Phoenix Framework).
  In case you want run Angular app, you will need install the "node_modules"
  folder in your IDE. (Suggestion: Create a new Angular app, and replace the "src"
  folder and the other angular files whit these in ang-app).
- sql-files: Folder contain sql scripts to create tables used in this project.
  for this project was used MariaDB/MySQL. You could try use other databases
  however it will require some libraries especific to each respective 
  database engine.
